# StrLua-Module

## 🙂 Introduction 🙂

Hello Developers.

Today my friend @gamer14_123 have made a module and decided to open source it for developers. The module will provides developers a set of string manipulation functions, similar to the str module in Python. Which allows you to perform various operations on strings, such as trimming, padding, truncating, searching, replacing, splitting, and formatting.

## **🧐 Why should you use it? 🧐**

People should use StrLua because it provides a convenient and efficient way to work with strings in Lua, similar to how the str module works in Python. By using StrLua, developers can write more concise and readable code, and avoid having to implement common string manipulation functions from scratch. Additionally, StrLua's functions are designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making it a great choice for anyone working with strings in Lua.
